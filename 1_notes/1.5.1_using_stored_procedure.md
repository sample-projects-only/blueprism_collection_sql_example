# using stored procedure to run sql queries:

## What is stored procedure?

- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again

## how to create and run stored proc?

- connect to database using SSMS or any other tool
- create stored proc as follows:
```text
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.PrintRow
AS
BEGIN
	select top 1000 brand_id,brand_name from nitindb.production.brands
END
```

- it will create stored proc in nitindb -> Programmability -> Stored Procedures
- we can now run stored proc as follows:
```text
EXECUTE nitindb.dbo.PrintRow
or
EXEC nitindb.dbo.PrintRow
```

## Stored proc can also accept input parameters

- create stored proc with input param
```text
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.ResultSet @brandname varchar(10)
AS
BEGIN
	select top 1000 brand_id,brand_name from production.brands where brand_name=@brandname 
END
```

- execute and get result
```text
EXEC dbo.ResultSet 'Trek'

Output:
brand_id	brand_name
9	Trek
```
